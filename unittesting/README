This was HW3 of APC524 of Princeton University in Fall 2010.
It shows the basic structure of unittesting as well as
some points to be careful about while testing math-intensive
functions. Below was the explanation for my solution to the
homework.

APC524 HW3 for Fethi M Ramazanoglu

-----------------------------------

I gave the aim of each test in the comments in the code

BUGS COUSING THE FAILURE OF PROVIDED TESTS: 
1. while numerically calculating the Jacobian, f(x+v)-f(x) was not
divided by dx
2. while iterating x to x+dx, h was added rather than subtracted

also
-maxiter=1 did not work, we added the +1 in the line 
        for i in xrange(self._maxiter+1): #add 1 
in Newton in newton.py

-we handle three exceptions

-if f(x) is still too big after maxiter iterations: NonConvergenceError
-if x_k gets too away from the initial guess x0 : DivergingRootError
-if the Jacobian becomes singular in the newton iteration 
(usually bc of numerical precision): SingularJacobianError
